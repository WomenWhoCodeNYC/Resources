# General Resources

Here are resources for coding-related tools and language-independent resources.

## Development 101
- **Computer Science**
  - **[Computer Science 101](https://www.coursera.org/course/cs101) (Coursera)** - teaches the essential ideas of Computer Science for a zero-prior-experience audience.  Introduces necessary jargon and explains computer terminology you'll need to know in order to program.

- **Command Line**
  - **[Codecademy: Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-the-command-line) - in browser instruction on learning Command Line/Teriminal
  - **Book: [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)** - teaches you the basics of command line, what it is and what commands you'll need.

- **Linux Administration**
  - **[Introduction to Linux](https://www.edx.org/course/linuxfoundationx/linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-2-introduction-5386#.VFgiEvTF8ww) (edX)** - "Develop a good working knowledge of Linux using both the graphical interface and command line, covering the major Linux distribution families."

## Version Control
- **Git**
  - **[Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) (Code School)** - a 15 minute challenge that teaches you the basics of Git via in-browser command line.
  - **[Git-it](https://github.com/jlord/git-it) (jlord)** - A workshopper module for learning Git and GitHub.
  - **[Learn Git Branching](pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/) (pcottle)** - An interactive visual tutorial to learn & understand git by completing small challenges.  Covers beginner through advanced techniques.  Great for programmers of all levels!  
  - **Video: [Git & GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) (Udacity)** - a super in-depth course on how to use command line Git and collaborating via GitHub.  A little long, but visually teaches the concepts behind Git and GitHub step-by-step.
  - **Video: [Git For Ages 4 And Up](  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ffBJ4sVUb4&t=6m45s) (YouTube)** - A very in-depth presentation that uses Tinkertoys to show what happens internally when you use the various Git commands.  (May be a bit obtuse for beginners)    



## **Code Challenges, Practice, and Technical Interviews**
- **[Typing.io](https://typing.io/)** - a typing tutor/trainer for programmers in JavaScript, Ruby, C, C++, Java, PHP, Perl, Haskell, Scala, and more.
- **[Exercism.io](http://exercism.io)** - practice problems for learning to code with real world feedback from other people on the same assignments.
- **[Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com)** - practice coding through challenges.
- **[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)** - "a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve."
- **[Programmer Interview](http://www.programmerinterview.com/)** - "helps programmers successfully prepare for technical interviews."
- **[Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/)** - "a study tool that preps software engineering candidates for coding interviews."

## **Phone a Friend**
  - **[Code Buddies](http://hangouts.codebuddies.org)** - remote peer-to-peer organized study hangouts.  Screensharing/sometimes-audio; no video sharing.

## **Resources Compiled by Others**
  - **[Free Programming Books: A List](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books)**
  - **[Code Newbie](http://www.codenewbie.org/learn)** - a list of sites and bootcamps that can help you learn.
