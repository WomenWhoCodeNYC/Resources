### [General Resources](general-resources.md)
Anything that isn't specifically front-end, back-end, or mobile such as learning how to use Git, programming lessons for beginners, etc.

### [Front-end Resources](frontend-resources.md)
Front-end is typically anything that users can see and interact with.  Includes design and development and a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
