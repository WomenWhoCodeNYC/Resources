This is a list of learning resources put together for [Women Who Code NYC](http://www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/).

### [General Resources](general-resources.md)
Anything that isn't specifically front-end, back-end, or mobile such as learning how to use Git, programming lessons for beginners, etc.

### [Front-end Resources](frontend-resources.md)
Front-end is typically anything that users can see and interact with.  Includes design and development and a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Usually consists of a server, application, and database.  The back-end stores information on a server and usually consists of languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, etc.

Pretty self-explanatory, these resources are for development on mobile devices.

### [Job Hunting Resources](job-hunting-resources.md)
